* Review Paycheck script that works the same way the timesheets script does
* As a side bonus for time entry, it doubles as a auditor

# Changelog:
Function wise, nothing has really changed, I added a bunch of features since the summer beta

* Optimized time entry a slight bit, time will now be entered from the Monday to Sunday of next week instead of from Saturday to Friday of the same week due to youth being inactive before Monday.
* Option for just auditing vs entering time as well
* Option to swap between entering time/auditing and Review Paycheck(when you choose one, it ignores the parameters for the other)
* Feature to auto color code the spreadsheet when the time is entered/correct(cornfield blue, this is for now hard coded may change in the future)
* Option to specify range of spreadsheet if one does not need the go through the entire spreadsheet, this also applies to review paycheck
added progressbar and numerical counter for gauging progress
* Feature added for segregating the two teams instead of having every team in the same list for easier access, changing the teams will also change the member list right below it, this is also saved in settings properly
* Added Week indication for the weeks dropdown so it's easier to tell what week you need entered. This needs to be added for review paycheck as well, ideally but that will come in a future update.

# Notes:
Google Chrome loves its updates, when the current packaged chromedriver no longer work, aka is outdated, please just google chrome driver and download the version that fits with the one installed on your computer and replace the one already in the package.
